# jax-firedrake
Differentiable interface to Firedrake for JAX.

~The code will be available soon. In the meanwhile, check out the equivalent JAX-FEniCS interface.~

[jax-fenics-adjoint](https://github.com/IvanYashchuk/jax-fenics-adjoint) now works both for FEniCS and Firedrake. Check `tests/firedrake` folders for the demos.
